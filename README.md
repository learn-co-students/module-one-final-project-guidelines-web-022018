# Module One Final Project - NBA Stats Alley-OOP

This program seeds a database full of projected and actual stats for individual NBA games by player. With the command line interface, you can search for game stats by player, by team aggregates, or by opponent aggregates. These stats can then be saved to csv (file name will be stats_export.csv - please save elsewhere or will be overwritten with the next save).

Installation Instructions:
To seed the database, navigate to the directory in command prompt and type the following commands:
1. rake db:migrate
2. rake db:seed
It will take a minute or so to seed the database with all data from players_stats.csv. You can then run the CLI with 'ruby bin/run.rb'.
